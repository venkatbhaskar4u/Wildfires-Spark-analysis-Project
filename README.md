# Wildfires Spark Analysis Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates scalable data analysis of wildfire activity leveraging **Apache Spark** and Python. It offers practical solutions for processing, analyzing, and visualizing large wildfire datasets, showcasing your ability to handle big data in environmental informatics and risk management scenarios.

## Key Features
- **Big Data Processing:** Uses Apache Spark to efficiently ingest, clean, and aggregate large wildfire datasets from multiple sources.
- **Data Exploration & Visualization:** Employs Spark SQL, DataFrames, and Python visualization tools to explore trends and patterns in wildfire frequency, intensity, and geographic distribution.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracts key variables (seasonality, causes, location clusters, meteorological context) for deeper analysis and modeling.
- **Performance Benchmarking:** Demonstrates Sparkâ€™s advantages over classical Python for parallel data wrangling and analysis.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Integrates mapping libraries or coordinates to highlight at-risk zones and regional trends (optional, if included).

## Technologies Used
- **Apache Spark** (PySpark)
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn (for post-Spark visualization)
- Optional: Geopandas, Folium, Plotly for spatial analytics

## Dataset
- Public wildfire datasets (e.g., US Forest Service, government open data portals)
- Data includes fire dates, locations, sizes, causes, and environmental factors

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/venkatbhaskar4u/Wildfires-Spark-analysis-Project.git`
2. Set up Apache Spark (local, standalone, or cluster) and configure Python environment.
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Launch and run the notebook (`Wildfires_Spark_Analysis.ipynb`) to execute Spark-based analytics and visualize trends.

## Example Results
- Identifies seasonal peaks and location clusters of wildfire incidents
- Compares Spark runtime to pandas/numpy for large-scale analytics
- Visualizes wildfire distribution over time and geography

## Applications & Impact
- Supports wildfire risk management, resource allocation, and policy decision-making
- Demonstrates production-level big data skills relevant for environmental analytics, insurance, and public safety
